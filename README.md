**Project Title:**  
"List of Most Creative Excuses for Missing Deadlines"

**Project Overview:**  
This project provides users with a platform to log in and view or contribute a collection of the most creative excuses people have used for missing deadlines. Each user gets a personalized list of excuses, with options to add, edit, or delete entries. The goal is to create a lighthearted and engaging application while demonstrating technical proficiency across the full stack.

**Key Features:**  
1. User authentication with personalized lists.  
2. View a curated list of excuses, categorized (e.g., "Outrageous," "Believable," "Funny").  
3. Ability to add your own excuses to the database.  
4. Edit or delete excuses from your personalized list.  
5. Upvote/downvote excuses to show popularity.  
6. Responsive design for mobile and desktop.  
7. Optional: Implement a “random excuse generator” feature for inspiration.

**Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** React with Vite for setup, CSS/Bootstrap for styling.  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js.  
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose for schema creation.  
- **Authentication:** JWT or Firebase Auth (optional).  
- **API Testing:** Postman or Bruno.  
- **Deployment:** Netlify/Vercel (frontend), Render/Heroku (backend).  

**Why This Project:**  
I picked this project because it's entertaining and relatable, yet it covers all key concepts from the course. It’s a playful way to practice CRUD operations, API integration, and front-end deployment. Plus, working on something humorous keeps the learning process fun and engaging while providing a unique idea that stands out in class.
